    Hi 👋🏻, my name is Daniel. I have been a software engineer for 9 years. I
    have had many hats during that time. I initially was a rails developer so I
    understand backend. I also had my own startup which grew to 50 developers. I
    exited in 2022. My last 4 years I was in Shopify building products. My last
    year I was in Hydrogen team which was an open source e-commerce framework.
    My biggest open source contribution was a Cart component used by big
    e-commerce sites to generate hundreds of millions during black friday.
